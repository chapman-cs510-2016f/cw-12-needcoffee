    "The `::`, called a scope operator, looks inside a namespace. For example, `foo::print()` is using the function `print` from the namespace `foo`. It is possible to omit the namespace name and just call the function by `using namespace the_namespace` to bring everything from the_namespace into local scope, but this is poor practice. It brings in functions and such that you do not intend to use, which could potentially conflict with the names of things you do intend to use."

The stream operator `<<` could then convert the C-string to a true C++ string. A stream is an object which performs input or output. Depending on where you are inputing or outputing, different streams are used. File io uses ofstream to write to a file, and ifstream to read from a file. Printing to standard output uses cout, and printing to standard error uses cerr."
